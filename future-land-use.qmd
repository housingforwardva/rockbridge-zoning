# Future land use

This section examines the the county's future land uses as defined and applied in the comprehensive plan.

rock_landuse_zoning <- read_rds("data/rockbridge/rock_landuse_zoning.rds")
rock_res_zoning <- read_rds("data/rockbridge/rock_res_zoning.rds")
rock_flu <- read_rds("data/rockbridge/rock_flu.rds")
rock_flu_area <- read_rds("data/rockbridge/rock_flu_area.rds")
rock_flu_desc <- read_csv("data/rockbridge/rb-future-land-uses.csv")

```

## Categories

The county's 2016 comprehensive plan defines seven different general land use categories to help guide future growth. This map shows where those categories are currently assigned throughout the county.

Shapefiles showing where each use is currently assigned were obtained for five of the categories, as shown below.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-flu-desc
#| tbl-cap: "Future land use categories and preferred uses"

rock_flu_desc |> 
  kable(
    col.names = c(
      "Category", "Residential", "Mixed use", "Commercial",
      "Industrial", "Public water and sewer"),
    align = "lccccc"
  ) |> 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c("hover", "condensed", "responsive")
    )


```

The remaining Institutional Area and Public Land designations do not have shapefiles; however, they are not critical for this analysis, and will be excluded.

## Distribution

- Residential land uses by parcel
- Residential land uses by land area

## Current versus future

- Where land uses are planned to remain the same
- Where land uses are planned to change
