This report is an analysis of zoning and land use patterns in Rockbridge County, the City of Lexington, and the City of Buena Vista. This work supports the ongoing [regional housing study](https://www.cspdc.org/programs-services/housing/) that HousingForward Virginia (HFV) and the Virginia Center for Housing Research (VCHR) are completing for the Central Virginia Regional Planning District Commission (CSPDC).

## Objectives

This analysis in this report supports three county objectives:

1. To better inform elected officials about housing development patterns, challenges, and opportunities,
2. To attract and solicit developers, and
3. To help apply for grants and other funding opportunities.

## Process

HFV will provide Rockbridge County with a comprehensive analysis of their current zoning regimen to determine challenges and opportunities related to the county’s housing needs as identified by VCHR.

This work will investigate and assess:

- The county’s current comprehensive plan,
- Existing residential and mixed-use zoning districts,
- Subdivision ordinance and related regulations, and
- Processes for rezonings, special use permits, and similar procedures to change the development potential of properties.

HFV will synthesize this analysis and provide a summary of findings, as well as potential recommendations that would work in sync with solutions offered in the full regional report.
