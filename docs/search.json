Nearly all of them are either residential (46.6 percent) or vacant (45.3 percent). All other uses comprise less than 3 percent on their own.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Percent of all parcels in Rockbridge County by land use category\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpreting the lack of “agricultural” parcels\n\n\n\nAccording to county assessment records, only two parcels were designated with the “farm” description, and thus assigned to the “agricultural” category. However, we know that many more parcels in the county are used for agricultural purposes, so it is reasonable to interpret that a significant share of the “residential” and “vacant” parcels include farming activities.\nFor more information on agricultural parcels in the county, see analysis of the A-1 and A-2 zoning districts in the next chapter.\n\n\nWithin just the 10,610 residential parcels, nearly all (90.3 percent) are single-family homes. Mobile homes on individual lots make up just under 8 percent; these include single-wides and double-wides. Only 173 parcels (1.6 percent) have townhomes or condos, and 27 parcels (0.3 percent) have apartments.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: Percent of all residential parcels in Rockbridge County by land use group\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSingle-family compared to multifamily parcels\n\n\n\nFor every parcel with a townhome, condo, or apartment building, there are another 48 parcels with single-family homes.\n\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Area\nExcluding Lexington and both towns, Rockbridge County is approximately 376,900 total acres. Residential and vacant parcels comprise the majority of this area, each accounting for about 35 percent of all land in the county.\nPublicly-owned lands make up nearly 25 percent of the county’s area, but just 1.3 percent of all parcels. These large tracts—including national forests and wildlife management areas—are permanently off limits to new development.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5: Percent of all land area in Rockbridge County by land use category\n\n\n\n\nThe total area of residential parcels in the county is about 132,850 acres. Single-family home properties account for nearly every acre—over 97 percent—of that land. The remaining land is almost exclusively parcels with mobile homes (2.8 percent).\nThe few properties with apartments, townhomes, or condos make up just over 200 acres. This is less than 0.2 percent of all the residential land in Rockbridge County.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6: Percent of all residential land area in Rockbridge County by land use group"

However, these values are right-skewed due to a small number of very large lots. Still, when using medians to account for this skew, the typical single-family lot is more than 60 percent larger than the typical lot with an apartment building.\nThe chart below shows the distribution of residential lot sizes by land use group.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.8: Lot size distribution of residential parcels in Rockbridge County by land use group\n\n\n\n\nDespite having the largest average sizes, there are many single-family lots one acre or less in size.

    "text": "1.4 Takeaways\nNotable findings from this analysis of current land use in the county include:\n\nThere are nearly an equal number of parcels used for homes as there are vacant parcels.\nNine out of ten residential properties are detached single-family homes. Less than two percent are used for townhomes or apartments.\nOver half of all lots with single-family or mobile homes are bigger than 2 acres.\nPublic property, primarily protected forests and conservation areas, makes up one-fourth of all land in the county.\n\nThe county’s current land use codes and descriptions could be improved for accuracy and legibility. For example:\n\n“Dwelling” can technically include many different types of units, but the county only assigns it to single-family detached homes.\nTownhomes, which would likely cover single-family attached units, are combined with condos. Condominium units are most often multifamily.\nMultiple codes are created to differentiate between “fair value” or “exempt” tax assessment designations. These assignments could be separated into a new standalone data field.\nThe revised categories and groups in Table 1.2 are an example of a standardized alternative structure.\nIn the long-term, the county may want to explore using the American Planning Association’s Land Based Classification Standards (LBCS)."

In B-1, they are conditionally permitted by-right if the structure meets the “area and setback requirements of the R-2 District if public water and sewer are available or the R-1 District if on a private drainfield and well or public water” [605.02-04]. This same rule applies to B-2; however, all B-2 developments must be approved via special exemption.\nTownhomes are only allowed conditionally in the R-2 district, and prohibited in all other zones. Townhome developments must meet special regulations found in section 709 of the zoning ordinance to be approved by-right.\nDuplexes are by-right in R-1 and R-2 and conditional in B-1, where the same area, setback, and utility requirements apply as described for single-family homes above. Duplexes are allowed via special exception in A-T and B-2.\nMultifamily developments are by-right only in R-2. In B-1, multifamily is possible only via apartments or condos included as basement or upper-story units included in structures that include other permitted uses. At least 90% of street-level space must be non-residential. Multifamily is possible via special exception in A-T and B-2.\nManufactured homes are allowed in all districts other than B-1 and B-2 if conditions in section 707 are met. That section requires new units be built according to HUD code (no pre-1976 units), placed on permanent foundation, titled as real estate, among other stipulations. Manufactured homes are allowed only via special exception in B-1 and B-2.\nManufactured home parks are prohibited in all districts except for A-2 and A-T, where they are allowed only via special exception.

However, this does not mean farming or harvesting does not occur on those lots; the county has just not assigned “agricultural” as the primary land use.\nVacant parcels most common within the A-1 or A-T zones, where they comprise 55.6 and 67.3 percent, respectively. In the A-2 district, single-family properties are the most prevalent, at just over 51 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Percent of R-1, R-2, B-1, and B-2 parcels by land use\n\n\n\n\nAmong the four non-agricultural districts that allow residential uses, single-family homes and vacant properties are still the most common parcel types. Well over half of R-1 properties are single-family homes, and another third vacant. Townhomes and condos make up almost 5 percent of R-1 parcels, despite being nonconforming uses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo “duplex” land use designation\n\n\n\nDuplexes are permitted in R-1 and R-2 by-right; however, the land use codes currently used by the county do not include a standalone duplex designation. According to the latest American Community Survey estimates, there are around 60 2-unit dwellings in the county. It is possible these properties are included in the “Townhouse/condo” land use code.\n\n\nTownhomes and condos are most common in R-2, where they make up over 12 percent of parcels. However, vacant lots (47.6 percent) and single-family homes (39 percent) are still much more prevalent in that district.\nTwo in three B-1 parcels are vacant (66.8 percent). The remainder are almost equally either single-family homes or commercial properties. Only 12 parcels are currently zoned B-2. Of those, most are single-family homes."

The chart below shows how the county’s vacant property is distributed by their current zoning district.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Percent of parcels and land area that are vacant within each zoning district\n\n\n\n\nJust under half of all vacant parcels are zoned A-2 (43.2 percent), but these account for two-thirds of all undeveloped area. Vacant A-1 lots are the next largest group when measured by area (25.8 percent), but only account for 8.4 percent of the total parcel count. Vacant parcels zoned A-T make up the next largest count (26.9 percent), but together are only 5.2 percent of land area.\nSingle-family detached homes are the only by-right residential use across these districts. (Manufactured homes are also permitted, but must meet certain conditional criteria.) Most other dwelling types are fully prohibited.\nJust about one in all five undeveloped lots are zoned for residential or business, with nearly all either R-1 or B-1. These are even a much smaller share of the total vacant area, comprising about 2.5 percent. These are the only vacant parcels where townhomes and multiple-unit dwellings are possible by-right, conditionally, or via special exception.\nThe chart below show how the current zoning ordinance allows (or restricts) different housing types as a percent of undeveloped parcels in the county.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6: Percent of undeveloped lots by residential use allowances\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverstated development potential\n\n\n\nThis analysis only considers the possible residential uses for each parcel, derived from the county’s zoning ordinance. It does not factor in other regulatory requirements, such as minimum lot sizes and setbacks. Road and utility access are also not included variables. Therefore, the share of vacant parcels actually suitable for development is likely much lower than these estimates.\nSee the next chapter for a more detailed assessment of residential development possibilities in the county.\n\n\nSingle-family detached homes are by-right on almost nine in ten empty lots, and are a conditional use on almost all other parcels. Manufactured homes share a similar distribution, but require conditional approval most everywhere.\nDuplexes are the next most common residential use allowed across vacant properties, where they are by-right in R-1 or R-1 (10.9 percent), or conditional in B-1 (10.5 percent). Multifamily apartments can be developed by-right on less than half a percent of all currently empty parcels, or conditionally on 10.5 percent. Both duplexes and multifamily homes would require a special exception (and public hearing) on 26.9 percent of vacant properties. These are nearly all zoned A-T.\nThe zoning ordinance fully prohibits apartments on 62.2 percent of undeveloped lots today, and duplexes on 51.7 percent. Townhomes are effectively banned everywhere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenges to manufactured home park development\n\n\n\nIn theory, new manufactured home parks are possible via special exception on 70.1 percent of vacant lots. However, the three-acre minimum lot size and other development requirements, along with larger market factors beyond county regulatory issues, make this scenario unlikely.\n\n\nThe maps below show what types of residential uses are allowed across presently vacant properties in the county.

    "text": "2.6 Takeaways\nRockbridge’s current residential zoning regimen is not particularly complex. And while the code is generally not amenable by-right housing development beyond single-family detached homes, several exceptions are noteworthy. These include duplexes by-right in R-1 and R-2, and apartments by-right in R-2.\nFurthermore, there are a few ambiguities in the county’s zoning data—and ordinance text—that make it difficult to correctly interpret and apply certain regulations.\nPreliminary findings and recommendations:\n\nDetermine with greater certainty how many A-1, A-2, and A-T properties are actually used for activities related to farming and cultivating natural resources.\nCreate consistent methodology/definition for parcels assigned with “NA” zoning.\nAdd clarity on current lot area requirements relative to utility access (Table 2 in zoning ordinance, page T2-1).\nExplore lowering barriers for townhome development, especially in R-1 and R-2 districts.\nConsider carving out a small-scale multifamily definition, such as three to four units per structure, whose development regulations could be less onerous than larger multifamily development."

These include Raphine (Exit 205 on Interstate 81) and Fairfield (Exit 200). This assignment primarily promotes motorist-oriented shopping and food service uses, along with other related commercial and light industrial activities. Residential uses are not mentioned.\nThese five categories are shown on the map below.\n::: {#fig-flu-map}"

While these property owners are likely to be more often than not still able to build a new single-family home by-right, Rockbridge County will not be actively supporting or guiding new residential growth into those areas.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Percent of all parcels in Rockbridge County by future land use\n\n\n\n\nMost other parcels (23.5 percent) fall into Suburban Service Areas, where residential development is encouraged. Almost 4 percent are in Rural Village Areas, and just over a percent each for Village Service Areas and Interstate Interchanges.\nMeasured by total land area, parcels in Rural Planning Areas account for almost 95 percent. Just over 3 percent is in Suburban Service Areas.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Percent of all land area in Rockbridge County by future land use"

These residences may feel pressured by continued commercial development into the future."

Parcels zoned A-T and A-2 in these areas should be re-evaluated to determine whether their lower densities are appropriate for the type of growth preferred in parts of the county served by utilities."
