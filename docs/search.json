It was last updated April 24, 2023 at 06:35 PM.\n\n\nThis report is an analysis of zoning and land use patterns in Rockbridge County, the City of Lexington, and the City of Buena Vista. This work supports the ongoing regional housing study that HousingForward Virginia (HFV) and the Virginia Center for Housing Research (VCHR) are completing for the Central Virginia Regional Planning District Commission (CSPDC)."

However, the data structures are not consistent. For example, the current land use designations for each parcel may be a field included in the parcel shapefile, or they must instead be joined using separate non-spatial real estate assessment records."

Data from Lexington and Buena Vista also include planned unit developments (PUDs).\nLike the GIS data, however, data structures are very different for each of the jurisdiction’s records. Significant effort is required to assess and rework the data to provide comparable analysis across all localities."

Public water service data has been received from Rockbridge and Buena Vista.\nMost local governments have limited or no in-house data on broadband coverage. However, the Virginia Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) is now required by code to collect and publish anonymized address-level records of broadband availability. The current dataset is published on the Virginia Open Data Portal:\nVirginia Locations Unserved by Broadband (last updated November 9, 2022)\nWe will use this spatial data to evaluate level of broadband service for all three localities."
