To account for these preserved areas, all parcels under public ownership were designated a new public property category by hand. The category is grouped according to which level of government owns the parcel.\nThe table below shows the revised land use categories and groups.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.2: Revised land use categories and groups\n\n\nCategory\nGroup\n\n\n\n\nResidential\nApartment\n\n\nResidential\nMobile home\n\n\nResidential\nSingle-family\n\n\nResidential\nTownhouse/condo\n\n\nPublic property\nCity property\n\n\nPublic property\nCounty property\n\n\nPublic property\nFederal land\n\n\nPublic property\nState land\n\n\nCommercial\nCommercial\n\n\nAgricultural\nAgricultural\n\n\nIndustrial\nIndustrial\n\n\nOther\nOther\n\n\nUnknown\nUnknown\n\n\nVacant\nVacant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis map shows general land use categories by parcel across Rockbridge County.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Land use categories in Rockbridge County\n\n\nThis map shows the specific residential use groups for current residential parcels only. All other uses are excluded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Residential land use groups in Rockbridge County\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Distribution\n\nAs share of parcels\nThere are a total of 22,777 individual parcels across Rockbridge County. Nearly all of them are either residential (46.6 percent) or vacant (45.3 percent). All other uses comprise less than 3 percent on their own.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Percent of all parcels in Rockbridge County by land use category\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpreting the lack of “agricultural” parcels\n\n\n\nAccording to county assessment records, only two parcels were designated with the “farm” description, and thus assigned to the “agricultural” category. However, we know that many more parcels in the county are used for agricultural purposes, so it is reasonable to interpret that a significant share of the “residential” and “vacant” parcels include farming activities.\nFor more information on agricultural parcels in the county, see analysis of the A-1 and A-2 zoning districts in Chapter 4.\n\n\nWithin just the 10,610 residential parcels, nearly all (90.3 percent) are single-family homes. Mobile homes on individual lots make up just under 8 percent; these include single-wides and double-wides. Only 173 parcels (1.6 percent) have townhomes or condos, and 27 parcels (0.3 percent) have apartments.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Percent of all residential parcels in Rockbridge County by land use group\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSingle-family compared to multifamily parcels\n\n\n\nFor every parcel with a townhome, condo, or apartment building, there are another 48 parcels with single-family homes.\n\n\n\n\nAs share of land area\nExcluding Lexington and both towns, Rockbridge County is approximately 376,900 total acres. Residential and vacant parcels comprise the majority of this area, each accounting for about 35 percent of all land in the county.\nPublicly-owned lands make up nearly 25 percent of the county’s area, but just 1.3 percent of all parcels. These large tracts—including national forests and wildlife management areas—are permanently off limits to new development.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: Percent of all land area in Rockbridge County by land use category\n\n\n\n\nThe total area of residential parcels in the county is about 132,850 acres. Single-family home properties account for nearly every acre—over 97 percent—of that land. The remaining land is almost exclusively parcels with mobile homes (2.8 percent).\nThe few properties with apartments, townhomes, or condos make up just over 200 acres. This is less than 0.2 percent of all the residential land in Rockbridge County.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6: Percent of all residential land area in Rockbridge County by land use group\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Analysis\nThe chart below shows the average and median lot sizes for the four different types of residential parcels found in the county.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.7: Average and median residential lot sizes in Rockbridge County by land use group\n\n\n\n\nAt almost 14 acres, the average size of a single-family lot is about twice as large as the average apartment property (6.83 acres), despite the latter accommodating multiple homes on each lot. However, these values are right-skewed due to a small number of very large lots. Still, when using medians to account for this skew, the typical single-family lot is more than 60 percent larger than the typical lot with an apartment building.\nThe chart below shows the distribution of residential lot sizes by land use group.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.8: Lot size distribution of residential parcels in Rockbridge County by land use group"

In B-1, they are conditionally permitted by-right if the structure meets the “area and setback requirements of the R-2 District if public water and sewer are available or the R-1 District if on a private drainfield and well or public water” [605.02-04]. This same rule applies to B-2; however, all B-2 developments must be approved via special exemption.\nTownhomes are only allowed conditionally in the R-2 district, and prohibited in all other zones. Townhome developments must meet special regulations found in section 709 of the zoning ordinance to be approved by-right.\nDuplexes are by-right in R-1 and R-2 and conditional in B-1, where the same area, setback, and utility requirements apply as described for single-family homes above. Duplexes are allowed via special exception in A-T and B-2.\nMultifamily developments are by-right only in R-2. In B-1, multifamily is possible only via apartments or condos included as basement or upper-story units included in structures that include other permitted uses. At least 90% of street-level space must be non-residential. Multifamily is possible via special exception in A-T and B-2.\nManufactured homes are allowed in all districts other than B-1 and B-2 if conditions in section 707 are met. That section requires new units be built according to HUD code (no pre-1976 units), placed on permanent foundation, titled as real estate, among other stipulations. Manufactured homes are allowed only via special exception in B-1 and B-2.\nManufactured home parks are prohibited in all districts except for A-2 and A-T, where they are allowed only via special exception. New MHP developments must meet the design and site plan requirements outlined in sections 707.02 through 707.06.\n\n\n4.1.2 Distribution\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Percent of all parcels in Rockbridge County by zoning district\n\n\n\n\nParcels zoned A-2 are the most common (49.5 percent) and comprise over half the county’s land area (52.7 percent). A-1 and A-T properties fill out another quarter of the county. Almost the full remainder of the county’s land is zoned for conservation (C-1), or does not have zoning assigned to it.\nWhile R-1 properties account for 14.4 percent of all parcels, they make up just 1.4 percent of all land. Other zoning districts where homes are allowed (R-2, B-1, and B-2) account for less than one percent of land.\n\n\n4.1.3 Land uses across districts\nThe charts below show how parcels within each zoning district are currently used.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: Percent of A-1, A-2, and A-T parcels by land use\n\n\n\n\nAmong agriculturally-zoned parcels, a majority are “vacant” or have a single-family home. However, this does not mean farming or harvesting does not occur on those lots; the county has just not assigned “agricultural” as the primary land use.\nVacant parcels most common within the A-1 or A-T zones, where they comprise 55.6 and 67.3 percent, respectively. In the A-2 district, single-family properties are the most prevalent, at just over 51 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4: Percent of R-1, R-2, B-1, and B-2 parcels by land use\n\n\n\n\nAmong the four non-agricultural districts that allow residential uses, single-family homes and vacant properties are still the most common parcel types. Well over half of R-1 properties are single-family homes, and another third vacant. Townhomes and condos make up almost 5 percent of R-1 parcels, despite being nonconforming uses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo “duplex” land use designation\n\n\n\nDuplexes are permitted in R-1 and R-2 by-right; however, the land use codes currently used by the county do not include a standalone duplex designation. According to the latest American Community Survey estimates, there are around 60 2-unit dwellings in the county. It is possible these properties are included in the “Townhouse/condo” land use code.\n\n\nTownhomes and condos are most common in R-2, where they make up over 12 percent of parcels. However, vacant lots (47.6 percent) and single-family homes (39 percent) are still much more prevalent in that district.\nTwo in three B-1 parcels are vacant (66.8 percent). The remainder are almost equally either single-family homes or commercial properties. Only 12 parcels are currently zoned B-2. Of those, most are single-family homes.\n\n\n4.1.4 Development potential\n\nMaps of where each housing type can be built by-right (and/or conditionally)\n\n\n\n4.1.5 Analysis\nThe existing zoning ordinance dictating land use and development in Rockbridge County has not been comprehensively rewritten since 1982. At this time, the County population was 17,856—about 5,000 people less than its population today.\nSince 1982, amendments have been made to the zoning code to address cases and uses not originally considered, but the overall form of the zoning code remains unchanged.\nFigure out which properties are actually used for agriculture"
