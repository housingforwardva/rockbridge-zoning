Nearly all of them are either residential (46.6 percent) or vacant (45.3 percent). All other uses comprise less than 3 percent on their own.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Percent of all parcels in Rockbridge County by land use category\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpreting the lack of “agricultural” parcels\n\n\n\nAccording to county assessment records, only two parcels were designated with the “farm” description, and thus assigned to the “agricultural” category. However, we know that many more parcels in the county are used for agricultural purposes, so it is reasonable to interpret that a significant share of the “residential” and “vacant” parcels include farming activities.\nFor more information on agricultural parcels in the county, see analysis of the A-1 and A-2 zoning districts in the next chapter.\n\n\nWithin just the 10,610 residential parcels, nearly all (90.3 percent) are single-family homes. Mobile homes on individual lots make up just under 8 percent; these include single-wides and double-wides. Only 173 parcels (1.6 percent) have townhomes or condos, and 27 parcels (0.3 percent) have apartments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: Percent of all residential parcels in Rockbridge County by land use group\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSingle-family compared to multifamily parcels\n\n\n\nFor every parcel with a townhome, condo, or apartment building, there are another 48 parcels with single-family homes.\n\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Area\nExcluding Lexington and both towns, Rockbridge County is approximately 376,900 total acres. Residential and vacant parcels comprise the majority of this area, each accounting for about 35 percent of all land in the county.\nPublicly-owned lands make up nearly 25 percent of the county’s area, but just 1.3 percent of all parcels. These large tracts—including national forests and wildlife management areas—are permanently off limits to new development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5: Percent of all land area in Rockbridge County by land use category\n\n\n\n\n\nThe total area of residential parcels in the county is about 132,850 acres. Single-family home properties account for nearly every acre—over 97 percent—of that land. The remaining land is almost exclusively parcels with mobile homes (2.8 percent).\nThe few properties with apartments, townhomes, or condos make up just over 200 acres. This is less than 0.2 percent of all the residential land in Rockbridge County.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6: Percent of all residential land area in Rockbridge County by land use group",

However, these values are right-skewed due to a small number of very large lots. Still, when using medians to account for this skew, the typical single-family lot is more than 60 percent larger than the typical lot with an apartment building.\nThe chart below shows the distribution of residential lot sizes by land use group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.8: Lot size distribution of residential parcels in Rockbridge County by land use group\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite having the largest average sizes, there are many single-family lots one acre or less in size.

Less than two percent are used for townhomes or apartments.\nOver half of all lots with single-family or mobile homes are bigger than 2 acres.\nPublic property, primarily protected forests and conservation areas, makes up one-fourth of all land in the county.\n\nThe county’s current land use codes and descriptions could be improved for accuracy and legibility. For example:\n\n“Dwelling” can technically include many different types of units, but the county only assigns it to single-family detached homes.\nTownhomes, which would likely cover single-family attached units, are combined with condos. Condominium units are most often multifamily.\nMultiple codes are created to differentiate between “fair value” or “exempt” tax assessment designations. These assignments could be separated into a new standalone data field.\nThe revised categories and groups in Table 1.2 are an example of a standardized alternative structure.\nIn the long-term, the county may want to explore using the American Planning Association’s Land Based Classification Standards (LBCS).",

It has not been comprehensively rewritten since then. At that time, the County population was 17,856—about 5,000 people less than its population today.\nSince 1982, amendments have been made to the zoning code to address cases and uses not originally considered, but the overall form of the zoning code remains unchanged.\nRockbridge County has nine base zoning districts and five overlay districts.\nTable 2.1: Zoning districts in Rockbridge County\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZone\nName\nOverlay\nType\n\n\n\n\nC-1\nConservation\nNo\nNonresidential\n\n\nA-1\nAgricultural and Limited Uses\nNo\nPrimarily Residential\n\n\nA-2\nAgricultural and General Uses\nNo\nPrimarily Residential\n\n\nA-T\nAgricultural Transitional\nNo\nPrimarily Residential\n\n\nR-1\nResidential General\nNo\nPrimarily Residential\n\n\nR-2\nResidential Mixed\nNo\nPrimarily Residential\n\n\nB-1\nGeneral Business\nNo\nMixed with Residential\n\n\nB-2\nPlanned Business\nNo\nMixed with Residential\n\n\nI-1\nGeneral Industrial\nNo\nNonresidential\n\n\nFH-1\nFlood Hazard\nYes\nNonresidential\n\n\nHistorical Overlay\n-\nYes\nMixed with Residential\n\n\nAgricultural/Forestal Overlay\n-\nYes\nMixed with Residential\n\n\nTC-O\nTourism Corridor Overlay\nYes\nMixed with Residential\n\n\nSource Water Protection Overlay\n-\nYes\nMixed with Residential\nThe map below shows the base zoning for each parcel in the county. Parcels with “NA” zoning in the county’s data are excluded. These 575 properties primarily include otherwise undevelopable land, such as the Blue Ridge Parkway.\nOf those nine base districts, all but two (C-1 and I-1) allow some form residential uses either by right, conditionally, or via special exemption.\nThe table below shows the allowances for different residential uses in those seven districts.\nTable 2.2: Residential use allowances\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZone\nSF detached\nTownhome\nDuplex\nMultifamily\nMH\nMHP\nADU\n\n\n\n\nA-1\nA\nP\nP\nP\nC\nP\nS\n\n\nA-2\nA\nP\nP\nP\nC\nS\nS\n\n\nA-T\nA\nP\nS\nS\nC\nS\nS\n\n\nR-1\nA\nP\nA\nP\nC\nP\nS\n\n\nR-2\nA\nC\nA\nA\nC\nP\nS\n\n\nB-1\nC\nP\nC\nC\nS\nP\nS\n\n\nB-2\nS\nP\nS\nS\nS\nP\nS\nAllowance key:\nResidential use definitions:\nSingle-family detached homes are by-right in five of the seven districts. In B-1, they are conditionally permitted by-right if the structure meets the “area and setback requirements of the R-2 District if public water and sewer are available or the R-1 District if on a private drainfield and well or public water” [605.02-04]. This same rule applies to B-2; however, all B-2 developments must be approved via special exemption.\nTownhomes are only allowed conditionally in the R-2 district, and prohibited in all other zones. Townhome developments must meet special regulations found in section 709 of the zoning ordinance to be approved by-right.\nDuplexes are by-right in R-1 and R-2 and conditional in B-1, where the same area, setback, and utility requirements apply as described for single-family homes above. Duplexes are allowed via special exception in A-T and B-2.\nMultifamily developments are by-right only in R-2. In B-1, multifamily is possible only via apartments or condos included as basement or upper-story units included in structures that include other permitted uses. At least 90% of street-level space must be non-residential. Multifamily is possible via special exception in A-T and B-2.\nManufactured homes are allowed in all districts other than B-1 and B-2 if conditions in section 707 are met. That section requires new units be built according to HUD code (no pre-1976 units), placed on permanent foundation, titled as real estate, among other stipulations. Manufactured homes are allowed only via special exception in B-1 and B-2.\nManufactured home parks are prohibited in all districts except for A-2 and A-T, where they are allowed only via special exception. New MHP developments must meet the design and site plan requirements outlined in sections 707.02 through 707.06.",

    "text": "2.5 Undeveloped lots\nThere are 10,312 undeveloped lots in zoning districts that allow residential uses. Together, these parcels total 129,982 acres of land. The chart below shows how the county’s vacant property is distributed by their current zoning district.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Percent of parcels and land area that are vacant within each zoning district\n\n\n\n\n\nJust under half of all vacant parcels are zoned A-2 (43.2 percent), but these account for two-thirds of all undeveloped area. Vacant A-1 lots are the next largest group when measured by area (25.8 percent), but only account for 8.4 percent of the total parcel count. Vacant parcels zoned A-T make up the next largest count (26.9 percent), but together are only 5.2 percent of land area.\nSingle-family detached homes are the only by-right residential use across these districts. (Manufactured homes are also permitted, but must meet certain conditional criteria.) Most other dwelling types are fully prohibited.\nJust about one in all five undeveloped lots are zoned for residential or business, with nearly all either R-1 or B-1. These are even a much smaller share of the total vacant area, comprising about 2.5 percent. These are the only vacant parcels where townhomes and multiple-unit dwellings are possible by-right, conditionally, or via special exception.\nThe chart below show how the current zoning ordinance allows (or restricts) different housing types as a percent of undeveloped parcels in the county.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6: Percent of undeveloped lots by residential use allowances\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverstated development potential\n\n\n\nThis analysis only considers the possible residential uses for each parcel, derived from the county’s zoning ordinance. It does not factor in other regulatory requirements, such as minimum lot sizes and setbacks. Road and utility access are also not included variables. Therefore, the share of vacant parcels actually suitable for development is likely much lower than these estimates.\nSee the next chapter for a more detailed assessment of residential development possibilities in the county.\n\n\nSingle-family detached homes are by-right on almost nine in ten empty lots, and are a conditional use on almost all other parcels. Manufactured homes share a similar distribution, but require conditional approval most everywhere.\nDuplexes are the next most common residential use allowed across vacant properties, where they are by-right in R-1 or R-1 (10.9 percent), or conditional in B-1 (10.5 percent). Multifamily apartments can be developed by-right on less than half a percent of all currently empty parcels, or conditionally on 10.5 percent. Both duplexes and multifamily homes would require a special exception (and public hearing) on 26.9 percent of vacant properties. These are nearly all zoned A-T.\nThe zoning ordinance fully prohibits apartments on 62.2 percent of undeveloped lots today, and duplexes on 51.7 percent. Townhomes are effectively banned everywhere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenges to manufactured home park development\n\n\n\nIn theory, new manufactured home parks are possible via special exception on 70.1 percent of vacant lots. However, the three-acre minimum lot size and other development requirements, along with larger market factors beyond county regulatory issues, make this scenario unlikely.\n\n\nThe maps below show what types of residential uses are allowed across presently vacant properties in the county. Parcels with any existing improvements are excluded.\n\n\n\n\nSingle-family detachedTownhomeDuplexMultifamilyManufactured homeManufactured home park\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.7: Maps of residential use allowances on vacant parcels",

And while the code is generally not amenable by-right housing development beyond single-family detached homes, several exceptions are noteworthy. These include duplexes by-right in R-1 and R-2, and apartments by-right in R-2.\nFurthermore, there are a few ambiguities in the county’s zoning data—and ordinance text—that make it difficult to correctly interpret and apply certain regulations.\nPreliminary findings and recommendations:\n\nDetermine with greater certainty how many A-1, A-2, and A-T properties are actually used for activities related to farming and cultivating natural resources.\nCreate consistent methodology/definition for parcels assigned with “NA” zoning.\nAdd clarity on current lot area requirements relative to utility access (Table 2 in zoning ordinance, page T2-1).\nExplore lowering barriers for townhome development, especially in R-1 and R-2 districts.\nConsider carving out a small-scale multifamily definition, such as three to four units per structure, whose development regulations could be less onerous than larger multifamily development.",

Based on those requirements, we can assume the following minimums for each district:\n\nA-T: 2 acres (single-family detached)\nR-1: 0.5 acres with public water and sewer and 1 acre without (single-family detached and duplex)\nR-2: 0.25 acres with public water and sewer (single-family detached and duplex); 0.5 acres with public water and sewer (multifamily)\nB-1: 0.5 acres with public water and sewer (multifamily)\n\nThe 0.5 minimum lot size for multifamily is assumed to apply to R-2 and R-1, and that multifamily is defined as three or more units. Therefore, the additional 2,000 sqft required would begin applying at the fourth unit.\nFor now, the lowest size minimum is applied as a filter. (Additional lot size requirements will be calculated in when utility access is considered.)\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.2: Number of minimum-sized vacant parcels by zoning district\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZone\nCriteria parcels\n\n\n\n\nR-1\n473\n\n\nA-T\n329\n\n\nB-1\n119\n\n\nR-2\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are 927 vacant parcels that meet the lowest minimum lot size requirement.

The map below shows those buffers, separated by which areas have access to water only, sewer only, or both.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Map of 500 foot buffer radius around public water and sewer lines\n\n\n\nSeparate shapefiles were provided for each utility; their coverage varied, as shown in the light green and light purple areas in the map, where only one service is available.\nBecause the lot sizes in R-1 and R-2 differ based on access to both water and sewer, we will use the blue shaded area to determine where those smaller criteria apply.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.4: Number of minimum-sized vacant parcels in growth areas with utility access by zoning district\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZone\nCriteria parcels\n\n\n\n\nR-1\n113\n\n\nB-1\n45\n\n\nA-T\n30\n\n\nR-2\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA subset of 194 of those properties have theoretical access to both water and sewer utilities.

    "text": "5.6 Takeaways\nLexington’s 2017 zoning code creates a relatively straightforward framework of seven districts, but establishes strong hierarchies in housing types and development potential. The code’s structure and implementation raise several notable points about housing diversity and development capacity.\nThe overwhelming dominance of R-1 zoning (68.5% of parcels, 46.6% of land area) combined with large minimum lot sizes creates a baseline of low-density development across much of the city. Given that R-1 contains 62% of the city’s undeveloped land, this represents a significant constraint on future housing development potential.\nCurrent treatment of housing types reveals stark disparities:\n\nNearly all undeveloped land (97%) allows single-family homes\nDespite by-right duplex permissions in R-1, R-M, and R-LC, the city lacks a mechanism to track these properties in its land use codes\n94% of undeveloped land prohibits townhomes and multifamily housing\nMinimum lot sizes are significantly larger for any housing type beyond single-family (e.g., 12,000 sq ft for duplexes vs 8,000 sq ft for single-family in R-1)\n\nSeveral opportunities for code modernization emerge:\n\nCreate a specific land use designation for duplexes to better track existing two-unit dwellings\nConsider reducing minimum lot sizes, particularly in R-1 and R-2, to enable more efficient use of available land\nExpand housing type permissions in R-2, which holds 32% of undeveloped land but currently prohibits everything except single-family homes\nReview the substantial setback and lot width requirements that may further constrain development beyond the basic lot size minimums\n\nThese changes would help maximize the development potential of Lexington’s limited remaining land while maintaining appropriate standards for community character and infrastructure capacity.",

    "text": "6.1 Zoning districts\nThis section examines current residential zoning patterns in the City of Buena Vista.\nThe existing zoning ordinance dictating land use and development was originally written in 1985. It has not been comprehensively rewritten since then. At that time, the city’s population was 6,470—only about 100 people less than its population today.\nSince 1985, amendments have been made to the zoning code to address cases and uses not originally considered, but the overall form of the zoning code remains unchanged.\nBuena Vista’s zoning code includes 17 distinct districts, with five primarily residential zones, eight mixed-use zones that allow residential development, and four nonresidential districts. The residential districts range from low-density R1 to medium-density R4, plus a planned unit development zone (PUD-R6). The mixed-use districts include traditional business zones (B1, B2), specialized Hill Top district development areas (PUD-RES-HT, MXB-HT), and corridor-specific zones (MUC).\nTable 6.1: Zoning districts in Buena Vista\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZone\nName\nType\n\n\n\n\nC1\nConservation\nNonresidential\n\n\nR1\nLow Density Residential\nPrimarily Residential\n\n\nR2\nResidential\nPrimarily Residential\n\n\nR3\nResidential Limited\nPrimarily Residential\n\n\nR4\nMedium Density Residential\nPrimarily Residential\n\n\nPUD-R6\nResidential Planned Unit Development\nPrimarily Residential\n\n\nB1\nGeneral Business\nMixed with Residential\n\n\nB2\nPlanned Business\nMixed with Residential\n\n\nLM\nLight Manufacturing\nNonresidential\n\n\nGM\nGeneral Manufacturing\nNonresidential\n\n\nREC\nRecreational\nNonresidential\n\n\nMU\nMixed Use\nMixed with Residential\n\n\nMB\nMixed Business\nMixed with Residential\n\n\nINST\nInstitutional\nMixed with Residential\n\n\nPUD-RES-HT\nPlanned Unit Development-Residential-Hill Top\nMixed with Residential\n\n\nMXB-HT\nMixed Use Business-Hill Top\nMixed with Residential\n\n\nMUC\nMixed Use Corridor\nMixed with Residential\nThe map below shows the base zoning for each parcel in the city.

With approximately 25% of R2/R3 land still vacant, there’s substantial opportunity to revise these districts’ regulations to allow more housing options.\nCurrent zoning creates a notable mismatch between allowances and actual development — while duplexes are technically permitted (with special exception) in R2 and R3 zones, the city lacks a clear land use designation to track them, and fewer than 30 likely exist citywide.\nThe code’s treatment of different housing types reveals these hierarchies:\n\nSingle-family homes are by-right in most residential and mixed-use zones\nTownhomes face restrictions in most zones except R4 and mixed-use districts\nDuplexes require special exceptions in most residential zones\nMultifamily is by-right in only two districts (R4 and MB)\n\nThe data suggests several opportunities for code modernization:\n\nCreate a specific land use designation for duplexes to better track this housing type\nExpand by-right permissions for townhomes and duplexes in R2 and R3 zones, where most developable land exists\nConsider reducing lot size requirements, particularly in R2 and R3, to enable more efficient use of available land\nStreamline the approval process for diverse housing types by replacing special exception requirements with clear by-right standards\n\nThe presence of multiple mixed-use and planned development districts suggests openness to flexible development approaches, but these zones affect relatively few parcels.
