However, the data structures are not consistent. For example, the current land use designations for each parcel may be a field included in the parcel shapefile, or they must instead be joined using separate non-spatial real estate assessment records."

Data from Lexington and Buena Vista also include planned unit developments (PUDs).\nLike the GIS data, however, data structures are very different for each of the jurisdiction’s records. Significant effort is required to assess and rework the data to provide comparable analysis across all localities."

Public water service data has been received from Rockbridge and Buena Vista.\nMost local governments have limited or no in-house data on broadband coverage. However, the Virginia Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) is now required by code to collect and publish anonymized address-level records of broadband availability. The current dataset is published on the Virginia Open Data Portal:\nVirginia Locations Unserved by Broadband (last updated November 9, 2022)\nWe will use this spatial data to evaluate level of broadband service for all three localities."

To account for these preserved areas, all parcels under public ownership were designated a new public property category by hand. The category is grouped according to which level of government owns the parcel.\nThe table below shows the revised land use categories and groups.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.2: Revised land use categories and groups\n\n\nCategory\nGroup\n\n\n\n\nResidential\nApartment\n\n\nResidential\nMobile home\n\n\nResidential\nSingle-family\n\n\nResidential\nTownhouse/condo\n\n\nPublic property\nCity property\n\n\nPublic property\nCounty property\n\n\nPublic property\nFederal land\n\n\nPublic property\nState land\n\n\nCommercial\nCommercial\n\n\nAgricultural\nAgricultural\n\n\nIndustrial\nIndustrial\n\n\nOther\nOther\n\n\nUnknown\nUnknown\n\n\nVacant\nVacant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Distribution\n\nAs share of parcels\nThere are a total of 22,777 individual parcels across Rockbridge County. Nearly all of them are either residential (46.6 percent) or vacant (45.3 percent). All other uses comprise less than 3 percent on their own.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Percent of all parcels in Rockbridge County by land use category\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpreting the lack of “agricultural” parcels\n\n\n\nAccording to county assessment records, only two parcels were designated with the “farm” description, and thus assigned to the “agricultural” category. However, we know that many more parcels in the county are used for agricultural purposes, so it is reasonable to interpret that a significant share of the “residential” and “vacant” parcels include farming activities.\nFor more information on agricultural parcels in the county, see analysis of the A-1 and A-2 zoning districts in Chapter 4.\n\n\nWithin just the 10,610 residential parcels, nearly all (90.3 percent) are single-family homes. Mobile homes on individual lots make up just under 8 percent; these include single-wides and double-wides. Only 173 parcels (1.6 percent) have townhomes or condos, and 27 parcels (0.3 percent) have apartments.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Percent of all residential parcels in Rockbridge County by land use group\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSingle-family compared to multifamily parcels\n\n\n\nFor every parcel with a townhome, condo, or apartment building, there are another 48 parcels with single-family homes.\n\n\n\n\nAs share of land area\nExcluding Lexington and both towns, Rockbridge County is approximately 376,900 total acres. Residential and vacant parcels comprise the majority of this area, each accounting for about 35 percent of all land in the county.\nPublicly-owned lands make up nearly 25 percent of the county’s area, but just 1.3 percent of all parcels. These large tracts—including national forests and wildlife management areas—are permanently off limits to new development.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Percent of all land area in Rockbridge County by land use category\n\n\n\n\nThe total area of residential parcels in the county is about 132,850 acres. Single-family home properties account for nearly every acre—over 97 percent—of that land. The remaining land is almost exclusively parcels with mobile homes (2.8 percent).\nThe few properties with apartments, townhomes, or condos make up just over 200 acres. This is less than 0.2 percent of all the residential land in Rockbridge County.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Percent of all residential land area in Rockbridge County by land use group\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Analysis\nThe chart below shows the average and median lot sizes for the four different types of residential parcels found in the county.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: Average and median residential lot sizes in Rockbridge County by land use group\n\n\n\n\nAt almost 14 acres, the average size of a single-family lot is about twice as large as the average apartment property (6.83 acres), despite the latter accommodating multiple homes on each lot. However, these values are right-skewed due to a small number of very large lots. Still, when using medians to account for this skew, the typical single-family lot is more than 60 percent larger than the typical lot with an apartment building."
