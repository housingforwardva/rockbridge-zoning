The analysis includes new factors, as well as information gathered in previous chapters, including:\n\n- Whether the property is already developed,\n- How residential uses are treated in the applicable zoning districts,\n- What the future land use designation is, and\n- Access to existing public utilities.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Property criteria\n\nStrategic residential development opportunities will ideally meet the following criteria:\n\n- Vacant parcel \n- Zoned A-T, R-1, R-2, or B-1\n- Meets applicable minimum lot size (see below)\n- Located in Suburban Service Area, Village Service Area, or Rural Village Area\n- Within 500 feet of public water *and* sewer\n\n### Land use and zoning\n\nApplying the first two criteria, there are 4,886 parcels currently vacant and zoned either A-T, R-1, R-2, or B-1. Over half are zoned A-T.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-rb-dev-luz .cell tbl-cap='Number of vacant parcels by zoning district'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-hover table-condensed table-responsive\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> Zone </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> Criteria parcels </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> A-T </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 2718 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> R-1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 1063 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> B-1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 1066 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> R-2 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 39 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Lot dimensions\n\nAs shown in the prior [zoning chapter](existing-zoning.qmd#sec-rb-lot-req), minimum lot sizes in Rockbridge's zoning ordinance are often conditional on other factors. Based on those requirements, we can assume the following minimums for each district:\n\n- **A-T**: 2 acres (single-family detached)\n- **R-1**: 0.5 acres with public water and sewer and 1 acre without (single-family detached and duplex)\n- **R-2**: 0.25 acres with public water and sewer (single-family detached and duplex); 0.5 acres with public water and sewer (multifamily)\n- **B-1**: 0.5 acres with public water and sewer (multifamily)\n\nThe 0.5 minimum lot size for multifamily is assumed to apply to R-2 and R-1, and that multifamily is defined as three or more units. Therefore, the additional 2,000 sqft required would begin applying at the fourth unit.\n\nFor now, the lowest size minimum is applied as a filter. (Additional lot size requirements will be calculated in when utility access is considered.)\n\n\n::: {#tbl-rb-dev-lot .cell tbl-cap='Number of minimum-sized vacant parcels by zoning district'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-hover table-condensed table-responsive\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> Zone </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> Criteria parcels </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> R-1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 473 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> A-T </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 329 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> B-1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 119 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> R-2 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 9 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere are 927 vacant parcels that meet the lowest minimum lot size requirement. Almost half are wither R-1 or A-T. Only 9 are zoned R-2.\n\n### Future land use\n\n\n::: {#tbl-rb-dev-flu .cell tbl-cap='Number of minimum-sized vacant parcels in growth areas by zoning district'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-hover table-condensed table-responsive\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> Zone </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> Criteria parcels </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> R-1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 388 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> A-T </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 124 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> B-1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 67 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> R-2 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 7 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere are 586 parcels that meet all above criteria and are located in a Suburban Service Area, Village Service Area, or Rural Village Area. The majority are zoned R-1.\n\n### Utility access\n\nWe can use a conservative estimation that any parcel within a 500 foot buffer of an existing water or sewer line is or could be connected to the system(s). The map below shows those buffers, separated by which areas have access to water only, sewer only, or both.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {#fig-ws-map}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n<iframe src=\"maps/rb_ws_map.html\" width=\"672\" height=\"400px\" data-external=\"1\"></iframe>\n:::\n\n\nMap of 500 foot buffer radius around public water and sewer lines\n\n:::\n\nSeparate shapefiles were provided for each utility; their coverage varied, as shown in the light green and light purple areas in the map, where only one service is available.\n\nBecause the lot sizes in R-1 and R-2 differ based on access to *both* water and sewer, we will use the blue shaded area to determine where those smaller criteria apply.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-rb-dev-ws .cell tbl-cap='Number of minimum-sized vacant parcels in growth areas with utility access by zoning district'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-hover table-condensed table-responsive\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> Zone </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> Criteria parcels </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> R-1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 113 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> B-1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 45 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> A-T </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 30 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> R-2 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 6 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nA subset of 194 of those properties have theoretical access to both water and sewer utilities. This remainder is still primarily zoned R-1.\n\n### Additional filters\n\nBased on a manual review of these remaining parcels, we can also exclude the following as unlikely to be suitable for residential development:\n\n- \"Vacant exempt\" parcels which are predominately owned by public or religious entities\n- Two parcels approximately over 100 acres owned and used by the Lexington Golf & Country Club\n\n[Reserved for further criteria if needed]\n\nThis removes an additional 20 properties.

One is a large wooded A-T lot, and the other a small R-1 lot fronting Route 130.\n\n[reserved for additional criteria/analysis following staff feedback]\n",
