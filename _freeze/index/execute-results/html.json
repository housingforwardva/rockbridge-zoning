It was last updated July 21, 2023 at 11:05 AM.\n:::\n\nThis report is an analysis of zoning and land use patterns in Rockbridge County, the City of Lexington, and the City of Buena Vista. This work supports the ongoing [regional housing study](https://www.cspdc.org/programs-services/housing/) that HousingForward Virginia (HFV) and the Virginia Center for Housing Research (VCHR) are completing for the Central Virginia Regional Planning District Commission (CSPDC).\n\n## Objectives\n\nThis analysis in this report supports three objectives:\n\n1. To better inform elected officials about housing development patterns, challenges, and opportunities,\n2. To attract and solicit developers, and\n3. To help apply for grants and other funding opportunities.\n\n## Process\n\nHFV will provide these localities with a comprehensive analysis of their current zoning regimens to determine challenges and opportunities related to housing needs as identified by VCHR.\n\nThis work will draw on the following information:\n\n- Current comprehensive plans and related documents,\n- Existing land uses by parcel,\n- Existing residential and mixed-use zoning districts,\n- Subdivision ordinances and related regulations, and\n- Recent residential development patterns.\n\nHFV will synthesize this analysis and provide a summary of findings, as well as potential recommendations that would work in sync with solutions offered in the full regional report.",
